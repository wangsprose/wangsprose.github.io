[{"content":"Amino acids and proteins The basic molecule units of proteins are amino acids. A amino acid consists of three major groups: amino ($-\\text{NH}_3^+)$, carboxylic acid ($-\\text{CO}_2{\\text H}$) and a side chain ($\\text{R}$). The carbon that attaches amino group is called alpha carbon. The following figure illustrates the simple structure of an amino acid.\nThe general structure of amino acid that consists of three groups: amino, carboxylic acid and side chain\nThere are 22 types of amino acides. It is the side chain that differentiates them. Two amino acids can form a peptide bond: the carboxylic acid group of one reacts to the amino group of the other, which yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. The formation procedure is shown below.\nThe formation of peptide bond\nIn a similar way, this peptide bond can react with other amino acids and form a chain which is named as polypeptide. Each \u0026ldquo;amino acid\u0026rdquo; in a polypeptide is called residue. The backbone of a polypeptide are the chain of nitrogen - alpha carbon - carbon. The following figure shows a backbone structure of a peptide bond.\nThe backbone of a peptide\nFor proteins, there are four levels of struture:\n1-d sequence of amino acides decided by peptide bonds. (Secondery structure) Folding of amino acides determined by backbone interactions (amino acides fold upon themselves). There are two motifs: $\\alpha$ helix $\\beta$ sheet (Tertiary structure) highly-order folding within a polypeptide depending on distant interactions. (Quaternary structure) the bonding of multiple polypeptides.
