[{"content":"Introduction There are many works for protein modeling regarding proteins as a 1-d sequences.

In this blog, I will introduce recent works on modeling protein structures.\nGVP One paper \u0026ldquo;Learning from protein structure with geometric vector perceptrons.\u0026rdquo; proposes a novel Geometric Vector Perceptrons (GVP) combining with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to model protein structure. More specifically, this paper focuses on modeling the first and second structures of proteins - amino sequence and the backbone of polypeptides. There are two major contributions of this paper. The first is the feature engineering.\nFeature Engineering For the $i$-th residue, there are four features extracted:\nFeature engineering for residues. Source:[1]\nIn addition, it constructs a graph $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E})$ from the polypeptides where the nodes of the graph are residues and the edges are formed as follows: each residue connects to $k$ neigbors that are closest to it in terms of the minimum euclidean distances. The features extracted for the edge from node $v_i$ to $v_j$ are the follows:\nFeature engineering for edges. Source:[1]\nEssentially, the first and second features encode the physical distance while the third one encode the sequential distance. Both node (residue) and edge feautures can be classified into two categories: scalar and vector. The scalar ones are traditional features while vector ones are designed to fully capture complex geometry.\nWith the constructed graph, an graph neural network is proposed to propogate node and edge features. In the propogation steps, a novel feature transforming layer called GVP is proposed, which is the second major contribution.\nGVP: Geometric Vector Perceptrons The GVP is designed to directly operate on scalar and vector features. The algorithm and its illustration is shown below.\nThe GVP algorithm. Source:[1]\nThe illustration of GVP. Source:[1]\nThe most important property of GVP is that vector and scalar outputs of the GVP are equivariant and invariant, respectively. Mathematically: if $\\bar{s}, \\bar{V} = \\text{GVP}(s, V)$, then $\\bar{s}, R(\\bar{V}) = \\text{GVP} (s, R(V))$, where $R(\\cdot)$ indicates an arbitrary composition of rotations and reflections. The original paper provides detailed proof for this property. In essence, it is achieved through the $L_2$ norm invariance with unitary matrix multiplication.\nReferences [1]Jing, et al. \u0026ldquo;Learning from protein structure with geometric vector perceptrons.\u0026rdquo; ICLR 2021\n","permalink":"http://wangsprose.github.io/posts/2022-07-22-modeling-protein-structure/","summary":"Introduction There are many works for protein modeling regarding proteins as a 1-d sequences.

It is the side chain that differentiates them. Two amino acids can form a peptide bond: the carboxylic acid group of one reacts to the amino group of the other, which yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. The formation procedure is shown below.\nThe formation of peptide bond\nThe structure of peptide bond can be discribed with Dihedral angles that are illustrated in the following figure.\nThe Dihedral angles of peptide bond\nIn a similar way, this peptide bond can react with other amino acids and form a chain which is named as polypeptide. Each \u0026ldquo;amino acid\u0026rdquo; in a polypeptide is called residue. The backbone of a polypeptide are the chain of nitrogen - alpha carbon - carbon. The following figure shows a backbone structure of a peptide bond.\nThe backbone of a peptide\nFor proteins, there are four levels of struture:\n1-d sequence of amino acides decided by peptide bonds.
